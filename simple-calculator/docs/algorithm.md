# Algorithm

first number = get input from user

if first number not numeric then print warning

second number = get input from user

if second number not numeric then print warning

operation = get input from user

lower case the operation for case insensitivity

if the operation is + or "add" then

    print first number + second number

otherwise if operation is - or "subtract" then

    print first number - second number

otherwise if operation is * or "multiply" then

    print first number + second number

otherwise if operation is / or "divide" then

    print firs number / second number

otherwise

    print warning
